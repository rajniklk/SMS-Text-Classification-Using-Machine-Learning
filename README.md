# SMS Text Classification Using-Machine Learning

We tried to predict the ham/spam label based on message length and punctuation counts. In this section, we'll look at the text of each message and try to perform a classification based on content. We'll take advantage of some of the sci-kit learn's feature extraction tools.

## Code and Resources Used

* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, Natural Language Toolkit, Regular expression.

## Data Handling

* Importing the libraries
* Importing the dataset
* Cleaning the texts
* Creating the Bag of Words model
* Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
* Training the model on the Training set
* Predicting the Test set results
* Evaluate performance

## Conclusion

Based on text alone we correctly classified reviews as positive or negative 98.96% of the time.
